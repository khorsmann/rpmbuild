========

These are my RPM packages and associated SPEC files for CentOS 6 and 7.

The prebuilt binary packages can be accessed by running the following command:

```
wget http://yum.webisp.uk/webisp-centos.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/webisp-centos.repo 
```

All RPMS are supplied with absolutely no warranty.
